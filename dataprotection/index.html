<p>The person responsible for data processing on this website is</p>
<p>Jalingo Management UG (limited liability)<br>
Ingo Czok<br>
Locarnoweg 6<br>
12205 Berlin</p>
<p>The responsible body decides alone or jointly with others on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, contact details, etc.)</p>
<h3 id="revocation-of-your-consent-to-data-processing">Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
<p>Only with your express consent are some data processing operations possible. A revocation of your already given consent is possible at any time. An informal notification by e-mail is sufficient for the revocation. The legality of the data processing carried out up to the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
<h3 id="right-to-appeal-to-the-competent-supervisory-authority">Right to appeal to the competent supervisory authority</h3>
<p>As a data subject, you have the right to complain to the competent supervisory authority in the event of a breach of data protection law. The competent supervisory authority with regard to data protection issues is the State Data Protection Commissioner of the federal state in which our company is located. The following link provides a list of the data protection officers and their contact details: <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html</a>.</p>
<h3 id="right-to-data-transferability">Right to data transferability</h3>
<p>You have the right to have data, which we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfilment of a contract, handed over to you or to third parties. The data will be provided in a machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.</p>
<h3 id="right-to-information-correction-blocking-deletion">Right to information, correction, blocking, deletion</h3>
<p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to obtain information free of charge at any time about your stored personal data, the origin of the data, its recipients and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correct, block or delete this data. In this regard and also for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time using the contact options listed in the imprint.</p>
<h3 id="ssl-or-tls-encryption">SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
<p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content that you send to us as the site operator, our website uses SSL or TLS encryption. This means that data that you transmit via this website cannot be read by third parties. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the &ldquo;https://&rdquo; address line of your browser and the lock symbol in the browser line.</p>
<h3 id="server-log-files">Server log files</h3>

This data is not merged with other data sources. The basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 letter b GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the fulfilment of a contract or pre-contractual measures.</p>
<h3 id="contact-form">Contact form</h3>
<p>Data transmitted via the contact form will be stored including your contact data in order to be able to process your enquiry or to be available for follow-up questions. These data will not be passed on without your consent.</p>
<p>The data entered in the contact form will be processed exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). A revocation of your already given consent is possible at any time. An informal notification by e-mail is sufficient for the revocation. The legality of the data processing operations carried out up to revocation remains unaffected by revocation.</p>
<p>Data transmitted via the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to its storage or until there is no longer any need to store the data. Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>
